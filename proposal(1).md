# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Space Fighter

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Top down space fighting game with different types of enemies and accelerated movement written on pygame. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will have compex movement with multiple waves on enemies based on score. The waves will become more difficult as time goes on. I would like a gui with options on resolution and sound. I would also like to see either different class spaceships or powerups that change how the game is played.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A game with movement, enemies, and high score.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

GUI with resolution options, sound options, and progressivley harder as time goes on.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A game with all of the above, as well as powerups/ spaceship class, multiple enemy types, and good assets. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to learn pygame syntax. I will also have to learn more about inputs and key pressing, mouse tracking. I will have to learn how to implement complex movement onto the player. I will start with reading or watching videos on how to represent acceleration in a python program. Then I will learn the basics of pygame (graphics, inputs etc.), then I will take time to make the game and learn how to make a rudimentary AI for enemies. If I can get the mechanics down I will move onto making the game more apealing visually, with better assets.
