# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Space shooter game with multiple types of enemies that appear from all sides of the window, gui (start, exit, sound mute/on,), highscore, accelerated movement using wasd and looking controlled with mouse cursor (probably using pygame) <--- leaning towards this financially cheap and seems more within reach

guitar pedal software/ raspberry pi (raspberry pi's out of stock and expensive)

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

None

## Do you have any questions of your own?
